# i $\subset$ aml

## Overview
This is an extension of a final project for a programming languages class that implements a subset of the OCaml language (with a few modifications for easier parsing and type checking). It is purely functional and includes a type checker that verifys the program is type-safe prior to execution, though there is currently no support for polymorphism. The source is written entirely in OCaml.
